This week, we just got our devices (2 HTC Vives and 1 Samsung HMD Odyssey), and we tried several games in VR mode such as Resident Evil 7, which can provide us with some good ideas about br horror game.

We decided to make an infinite loop inside our horror game since infinite can save us art assets which were difficult to find. And we decided that everyone in our team should find some good art assets for horror game. We will choose some perfect assets and report to professor next week.
