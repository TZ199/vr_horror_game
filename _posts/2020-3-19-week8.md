This week, we just ended our spring break and started development level 2. Also, we received feedback for our midterm submissions.  There are some important suggestions from feedback:

1. We need to figure out a system that could tell players if the items can be interacted or not.
2. We need to make sure that every element has a purpose and that everything is connected to each other.
3. Our current scene is basic (half-greybox scene).
4. The sound is ok but doesnâ€™t seem well curated, we need to polish it in the future.
5. We need to implement the end goal of our game and make it clear for players.
6. Probably we need to implement a narrative system and introduce our story to players.
