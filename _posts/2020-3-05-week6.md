This week we continued implementation of midterm tasks. We already got our story framework and our theme â€”  helping to find happy memories in life. Therefore, we designed a detailed story for loop 1 (level 1). Also, we implemented a classical horror scene: While player enters a specific room, a terrifying ghost will appear outside of this room. The ghost will walk around this room and player can see it through windows. As the ghost walking around, all furnitures will fall down. At the meanwhile, we will also switch our ambience sound to a tensed one.

Our current scene still needs some regulation, the door looks too high for player and the table is too small for player.
