This week, we mainly worked on polishing our level 1 and designed level 2. We added better textures into level 1 and reduced the lightness of level 1. We thought that darker environment can help improve horror experience. Also some users say that lowering the brightness can help players reduce the sickness level.

Level 2 will focus on horror experience in VR instead of puzzles. We designed some new features for level 2: A foggy loop between level 1 and level 2, since the player will walk in a foggy environment, palyer can see nothing clearly. We will add an event where the ghost can walk around inside the foggy environment. The second feature is "flashing light". Once player walk through an area, the light will keep flashing.
