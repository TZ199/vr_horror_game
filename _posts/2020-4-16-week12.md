This week, we worked on finishing level 2. Level 2 contains these puzzles: The phone call will tell players that their favorite family activity was sitting together and talking about a book. So the players need to find a book and a photo of hostess, then put them on the table (there will be a highlighted outline telling players where to put). 

Also the final submission is approching, we needs more play tests to make sure there is no 

We currently use a robot-like hand, professors gave us a VR hands asset to replace. Also, our level indicator -  digital clock looks like a TV, therefore, we designed a new level inidcator: Wall lamps. If player solve puzzles in level 1, the wall lamp on left side will be turned on. If players solve level 2, all the wall lamps will be turned on. This looks better than a digital clock.
