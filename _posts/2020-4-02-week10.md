This week we focused on implementation of level 2. The basic story of level 2 is : The wife of the man (ghost) is going to have a phone call after the player enters the second room. And she will tell the player their favorite familty activity. Players can get hint of the puzzles and solve these puzzles. 

We needed to implement a phone calling system in our game and make the voice from wife spatial so that players can have a real phone calling experience. We also integrated "light flashing" event into level 2.

We also implemented a "digital clock" which indicates players which level they are currently in. Currently, it can only display one digit number, 0 means level 1 and 1 means level 2.
