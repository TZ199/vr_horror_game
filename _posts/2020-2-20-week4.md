At the beginning of this week, we wanted to start implementation of some game mechanics. However, we realized that we should decide our game art design and story design first. Because, our game will mainly focus on storytelling, therefore, our game mechanics will highly couple with our art assets and story design. 

Then we decided to find more environment art assets and find more horror stories as reference. At Monday (02/24), we found three type of environment assets: Hospital, Haunted House and Subway station. Accordingly, we find horror stories for these three scenes. Finally, we decided to use haunted house as our main scene and use some horror stories as our shorytelling reference.

And we still partitioned our team into 3 sub-teams. One team will focus on programming, one team will focus on building environment and the last one will focus on sound effect.
