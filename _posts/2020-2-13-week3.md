This week, some of us were continuing learing Unreal Engine. Since three of us have experience about Unreal, we divided our group into 3 sub-groups with 1 experienced unreal engineer. 

This week, our main purpose focused on basic functionalities such as controlling system and teleporting system. During the development, we met with one big problem. Unreal Engine cannot map Windows Mixed Reality controller joystick with built-in input system. After a long time research, we found that SteamVR driver disabled it. 
According to the solution in this website: [https://www.windowscentral.com/how-enable-windows-mixed-reality-joysticks-any-steamvr-game](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-enable-windows-mixed-reality-joysticks-any-steamvr-game)

We changed some setting veriables in SteamVR driver files.
