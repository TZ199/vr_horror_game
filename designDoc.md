## Inspirations
Our horror game is inspired by P.T. and many horror movies. The key feature is the infinite loop. We are going to build an immersive gaming environment that could make players feel like in the real world but with some terrifying events.


## Game Overview
Our game will mainly focus on storytelling and building immersive game experience. Our game is inspired by a true event at New York 122 Ocean Avenue, Amityville Horrorâ€™ house. On the night of November 13, 1974, a man killed his entire family. When he was taken by police, he claimed that he heard voices commanding him to kill. But no one believed that. 
Our story is inspired by this event. A man was gradually deceived and induced by something evil, then killed his entire family. Then he became the haunting ghost of this house. In our game, instead of fighting with this ghost, the player will help this ghost to recall all happy memories in his life, and will eventually make him free and end this haunting event.
